<h3>Little bittle bout me:</h3>
<p>In West Oakland, born and raised, in Chinatown is where I spend most of my days. April 8th, 2000 was the best day of your lives. Parents came fresh out of the Philippines and Cambodia, #represent. Concurrently enrolled at Alameda Science and Technology Institute and Peralta Community Colleges. I'm an upcoming senior and very happy to be here.
